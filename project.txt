This is a process of assessing learner needs.can resemble investigation: Is the perceived problem real? Are there hidden problem elements? CAN training solve this problem? Are sufficient numbers required to attend? Is the audience computer-competent? Do they have access to computers? Can they access audio or attend at scheduled times? Do they speak English? Is there resistance to change? Are stakeholder expectations clear? The unknown has the power to undermine a great effort. You must find answers quickly and efficiently. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Rollover_Caption_10","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Rollover_Caption_10","title":"Design is where solutions are made. Enabling objectives are determined, assessment strategy is determined, the course structure is outlined, and a standard approach to similar learning challenges finds an initial formula. Much of our design, including chunking and standardized approaches (e.g., our general structure and pattern for addressing definitions) are managing cognitive load and streamlining knowledge transfer. A storyboard will communicate our plan to stakeholder and subject matter experts (SMEs). We won’t develop custom images, interaction, video, or audio, until we confirm stakeholder approval. The actual written content will be created at this stage. Besides presenting design to the stakeholder, the storyboard is also a specification document directing supporting developer activities.  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Rollover_Caption_11","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Rollover_Caption_11","title":"Development is the assembly area. It also involves some of the more demanding work. Development may involve documents for classroom or job aides, a PowerPoint, or web development. The ISD may be developing content with tools like Captivate and Storyline, and tools for video, audio, and visual creation and editing. Development may include coding elaborate object oriented game elements. Sometimes development is done by the ISD alone and other times by a team of specialists under ISD direction. Robust testing is an important part of development. The last step in development is to assemble the course in the LMS for sample audience testing. This is known as beta testing. Here we’ll observe learners and attempt to identify flaws in our design. We’ll make changes to improve effectiveness and usability.

This includes: \t•\tTesting course and correcting any issues. \t•\tObtaining stakeholder sign-off. \t•\tNotifying managers of course availability or entering required learner parameters.. \t•\tSecuring course source files enabling easy access for edit and update. \t•\tNotifying stakeholders that the course is life and the project is complete.much of implementation occurs during beta testing.

Ideally, this is performed independently. Level 4 is the ultimate measure of learning performance.  1. Survey learner satisfaction. 2. Measures learning gained from the course (same test before and after the learning). 3. Measures how much of learning is seen in job practice.* 4. Measures return on investment (change in problem metrics).* *These measurements typically begin 30 to 60 days after course delivery, and are repeated at intervals.
